The temperature in Chennai exists somewhere between 280C to 330C in a particular 
week. The temperature in Delhi is 8
0C lesser than in Chennai. Likewise, the 
temperature in Haveri is 5
0C more than that of Chennai. Write a C program to find the 
temperature of Gangtok for a particular week, which is the temperature difference 
between Delhi and Haveri. Get the temperature of Chennai (
0C) as input for the week 
of 7 days and the temperature of Gangtok (
0C) as output for the week of 7 days. 
Implement the program using arrays and validate the rules


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int chennai[7];
    int delhi[7];
    int haveri[7];
    int gangtok[7];
    int i;

    printf("Enter temperature for Chennai for the week:\n");
    for (i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
        printf("Day %d: ", i + 1);
        scanf("%d", &chennai[i]);
        if (chennai[i] < 28 || chennai[i] > 33) {
            printf("Temperature for Chennai should be between 28C and 33C\n");
            return 1;
        }
    }
    for (i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
        delhi[i] = chennai[i] - 8;
        haveri[i] = chennai[i] + 5;
    }

    for (i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
        gangtok[i] = haveri[i] - delhi[i];
    }

    printf("Temperature for Gangtok for the week:\n");
    for (i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
        printf("Day %d: %dC\n", i + 1, gangtok[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
